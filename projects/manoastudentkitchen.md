## Why Manoa Student Kitchen?
College students are often extremely busy, and as such, lack the time to cook elaborate meals. There are also those for whom cooking their own meals is too expensive or difficult.  This is the problem that Manoa Student Kitchen aims to help solve. 

Manoa Student Kitchen is an application that allows students at UH Manoa to share their simple recipes with others that are both affordable and easy to make (requiring no more than a toaster oven). Students who may know a few simple recipes, even if they lack the time to make them themselves, would be able to share them with others who may be looking for something simple and easy to cook up. As keeping costs down is an important part of college life, the app aims to inform students of the cost of each ingredient, as well as of the ideal location to obtain it.
