summary: Implementation of Tetris using DLX Assembly done for ICS 331 (Requires Logisim)
---

This is the final project I did for ICS 331: Logic Design & Microprocessors. It is an implementation of Tetris in a logic simulator using DLX assembly. It makes use of 32 32-bit registers along with a frame buffer to display the screen.

The game has the following functions:
- Piece Rotation
- Piece Movement
- 4 different pieces
- Scorekeeping
