Fey Anthology is a Social Bookmarking web app that I have been working on as a side project. Social bookmarking services are centeralized web services where users can collect and share links to web documents. 

Fey Anthology is meant for online sub-communities with very specific topical focuses that nonetheless spans multiple media forms (eg. stories/articles, art/photography, videos, etc). Such a community might be found within a single multi-page forum thread on an online forum, for example. Resources of interest to these sub-communities may be abundant, but are often spread across multiple sites and mixed in with stuff that is only peripherally relevant.


Laravel, AngularJS, and Postgresql.

Fey Anthology is meant to be modular, meaning that anyone could install the system on their own site and have their own database to share links among their online community.

The most recent version can be found [here](http://feyanthology.herokuapp.com/).
