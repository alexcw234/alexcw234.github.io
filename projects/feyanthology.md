Fey Anthology is a Social Bookmarking web app that I have been working on as a side project. Social bookmarking services are centeralized web services where users can collect and share links to web documents. 

People who participate in online forums (and similar) form online communities around common interests. Within these communities, however, many participants contribute to just one or a few topics amongst the set of topics covered by the site, essentially forming a collection of sub-communities.

Fey Anthology is meant for online sub-communities with a very specific focus that nonetheless spans multiple media forms (eg. art/photography, stories/articles, videos, etc). Resources of interest to these subcommunities may be abundant, but are often spread across multiple sites and mixed in with other content that is only peripherally relevant. Insufficient specificty of search features can make finding resources difficult and sometimes (especially when the site features infinite scrolling) even *annoying* to access.
I started this project therefore to create a way for these sub-communities can archive and easily access relevant content.

My other objective through this project was to gain knowledge of web frameworks and web development. As I had been already using PHP for my ICS321 class (Data storage and Retreival), I chose to use the PHP framework Laravel for the backend to build off of what I already knew. 
AngularJS, and Postgresql.
