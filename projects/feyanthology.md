Fey Anthology is a "Social Bookmarking Service", using Laravel, AngularJS, and Postgresql.

Wikipedia defines "Social Bookmarking" as: "a centralized online service which allows users to add, annotate, edit, and share bookmarks of web documents." [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking)

Fey Anthology is meant to be modular, meaning that anyone could install the system on their own site and have their own database to share links among their online community.

The most recent version can be found [here](http://feyanthology.herokuapp.com/).
