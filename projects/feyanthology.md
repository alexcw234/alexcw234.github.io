Fey Anthology is a Social Bookmarking web app that I have been working on as a side project. Social bookmarking services are centeralized web services where users can collect and share links to web documents. 

###Background Information
People who participate in online forums (and similar) form online communities around common interests. Within these communities, however, many participants contribute to just one or a few topics amongst the set of topics covered by the site, essentially forming a collection of sub-communities.

Fey Anthology is meant for online sub-communities with a very specific focus that nonetheless spans multiple media forms (eg. art/photography, stories/articles, videos, etc). Resources of interest to these subcommunities may be abundant, but are often spread across multiple sites and mixed in with other content that is only peripherally relevant.


Laravel, AngularJS, and Postgresql.

Fey Anthology is meant to be modular, meaning that anyone could install the system on their own site and have their own database to share links among their online community.

The most recent version can be found [here](http://feyanthology.herokuapp.com/).

The source code is on my github [here](https://github.com/alexcw234/feyAnthology).
