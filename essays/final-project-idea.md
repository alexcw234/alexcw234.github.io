# Overview 
The problem: Students are not fulfilling their daily micro-nutrient requirements. Fulfilling micro-nutrient requirements is important as it helps improve focus, brain function and basic quality of life.

The solution: Why don't we have something that helps students track their micro-nutrients. This would allow students to simply pick menu items from their favorite restaurants on UH and would automatically update their micro-nutrient profiles. If your meal plans don't successfully fulfill your nutritional requirements, the app would suggest foods that you could eat that fulfill these requirements.

# Mockup page ideas

Of course there should be a login page that takes UH logins.

There should be a profile page where a user can add their info.

A accountability page, statistics. This would show the days on which you have and have not met the micro-nutrient requirements as well as how you compare to other users of the app.

The app should have a list of food places. Every food place will have its own page that shows the list of food items from that place. You would select a food item and it would be added to your nutrient log.

There should be Admin functions for food place owners to add their food items.

# Use case ideas

Login, add menu items, search restaurants, search restaurant menu, delete menu items, view profile, enter information, view your nutrient requirements, modify your requirements, view statistics, deficiency notifier, information on nutrients, nutrient overdose notifier, dietary needs/preferences.
