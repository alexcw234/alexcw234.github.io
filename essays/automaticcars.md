## An Article for Thought
What does ethics mean in software engineering? Well my immediate response to that question is "you see this thing that could hurt people, don't do the thing".
But, in thinking about that question, I read [this article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/) on self-driving cars titled "Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill".
I think that the article definitely provided some interesting things to think about simply by bringing up the point that there will be situations in that it would be impossible to avoid a death-causing accident.
This is why ethics can't be simplified to simply "this thing could hurt people, so don't do the thing". That is, except when it can.
