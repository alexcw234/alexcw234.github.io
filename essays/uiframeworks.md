###Why I like having a framework
I should start off by saying that the visual and user-interface aspects of software engineering are something that I struggle with. Although it's easy for me to decide that I don't like something/what doesn't work in terms of a website's interface, pinpointing what I *do* like/what *does* work is a challenge. The same, I find, carries over to non web-based projects as well. While I eagerly wrote the classes and methods for a card game for a fun project, once it came to figuring out the front-end framework I quickly grew impatient. Although I have an artistic background in music, it doesn't translate well to visual art. I think having a ui framework is helpful for me as it gives me a general idea of what looks good that I can base my design off of. Although learning to use the framework in itself takes time and effort, I find that it is worth it in the long run as less time is spent on trivial things such as positioning, allowing you to focus on the larger and/or functional elements of a site.

Prior to learning about semantic ui, I have had experience using bootstrap in my previous projects. I didn't find the learning curve to be too difficult and it definitely made creating websites easier over usign plain CSS, *especially* in making a site look good on mobile devices. 

By contrast, in a previous project I did for my work, I was assigned to create the professor I work for's personal webpage. As he wanted the site to be easily editable by a non-programmer, I had to design a site that could be edited by a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" editor, which meant using only html and minimal CSS. This process was exceedingly tedious and I did find myself falling back on bootstrap for several things like the navigation bar. From this I really understood the value of having a framework.

Comparing Semantic UI to Bootstrap, Semantic's features seemed a lot simpler to implement than Bootstrap in terms of amount of typing required, which I really like. On the other hand, Semantic's syntax will take some getting used to, especially since sometimes the adjectives are inconsistant (is it middle or or center?). I know that some of the Angularjs plugins that I have been using depend on Bootstrap, so I wouldn't be able to use it in my current personal/work projects, but I actually like the appearance of Semantic's classes better than Bootstrap's classes and would definitely be willing to try out the framework in the future.
