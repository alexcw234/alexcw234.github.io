## I think this has become a pattern...
I spent the past few weeks learning the basics of the Meteor web framework. Similar to how I had an initial attempt at learning Javascript several months before learning Javascript for real, this was not my first attempt at learning Meteor. And, like my initial impression of Javascript, my first impression of Meteor was not the best.

Due to a misunderstanding in which I was advised to use a local-storage database when I actually needed a server-side database (after which I spent the next week or so getting frustrated over the whole concept of how multiple clients could possibly share data without ever talking to each other), I developed misgivings about pushing data to any form of database that I didn't understand. So when the first Meteor tutorial I followed introduced MongoDB by telling me to type inputs into a browser command prompt, it raised red flags.
