## I think this has become a pattern...
I spent the past few weeks learning the basics of the Meteor web framework. Similar to how I had an initial attempt at learning Javascript several months before learning Javascript for real, this was not my first attempt at learning Meteor. And, like my initial impression of Javascript, my first impression of Meteor was not the best.

Due to a misunderstanding in which I was advised to use a local-storage database when I actually needed something server-side (after which I spent the next week or so getting frustrated over the concept of data "magically" floating across multiple devices' local storage), I developed misgivings towards unfamiliar databases. So when the tutorial I looked at for Meteor told me to insert some sample data by typing into the browser command line, it raised red flags for me, being too much like what I had been vexing over before. Further, it just seemed "too" easy. Apparently, I could type in data and it would just be stored in the database. No setup! (at least, in that tutorial) But, coming from learning about SQL and relational databases, the lack of setup (at least, in that tutorial) was precicely why I didn't feel comfortable. It all just seemed too, and I don't really have a word for this but, "floaty". In fact, I still don't feel completely comfortable with this even now, but it's gotten better.

## A New Attempt
