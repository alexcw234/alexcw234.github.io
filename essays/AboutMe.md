## How I ended up studying computer science.

I am a 2nd Bachelor's student at UH Manoa studying Computer Science, although it would actually be my 3rd Bachelor's degree. Prior to this I attended Oberlin College in Ohio where I completed a double degree program in Chemistry and Violin performance. During my time at Oberlin I never would have guessed that I ultimately would decide to pursue a career in the technology field.

I originally decided to major in chemistry with a plan to apply to medical school, but soon became more interested in scientific research. Majoring in music was a personal desire: I have played the violin for most of my life and the chance to study at an internationally reknowned music conservatory was too good to pass up.
