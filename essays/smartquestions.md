### Why Smart Questions are good for Smart Software Engineers

When needing help with something in software engineering, or any field really, it's important to ask smart questions in order for the people who are answering these questions to understand what it is you require so that they may give you answers that will best help you.
A question being "smart" isn't limited to simply having correct spelling and grammar. In order for someone to give a good answer it is important that they understand the precise details of the problem itself as well as what the end goal of solving the problem is. Not providing these things could lead to one receiving an answer that does little to help them with their problem.
