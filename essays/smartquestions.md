### Why Smart Questions are good for Smart Software Engineers

When needing help with something in software engineering, or any field really, it's important to ask smart questions in order for the people who are answering these questions to understand what it is you require so that they may give you answers that will best help you.
A question being "smart" isn't limited to simply having correct spelling and grammar. In order for someone to give a good answer it is important that they understand the precise details of the problem itself as well as what the end goal of solving the problem is. Not providing these things could lead to one receiving an answer that does little to help them with their problem.

[Here is an example of a bad question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39941199/how-to-disable-the-back-button-in-my-browser)

The question provides very little background information. Actually, as stated by the first commentor, the code that is provided has nothing to do with the question being asked. Secondly, the question is a duplicate of questions that had been asked previously and may have been answered with a simple search.

[Here is an example of the same question but asked "smarter"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12381563/how-to-stop-browser-back-button-using-javascript?noredirect=1&lq=1)

As shown, the person provides both what they are trying to acheive and the background information on the question itself. Knowing why they want to disable the back button leads the people answering to not only be more willing to answer the question, but able to offer more constructive responses and alternatives to disabling the back button (which, as they explain, is not generally a good idea).

I think in general knowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is helpful to getting the information that you want quickly and accurately. People don't want to read the same questions asked over and over when a quick search could have solved the problem. Likewise, people are more willing to answer questions that are asked well with sufficient details.
