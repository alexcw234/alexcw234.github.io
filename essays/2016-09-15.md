I think configuration management is an important concept in software engineering. Often times you will be working with many people on the same project. Without an effective organization system, problems will certainly occur. A change to one piece of code may break something else elsewhere, one person's additions could be based off of earlier code that had since been changed, or two (or more) people could be trying to make changes to the same piece of code. As such, it is important to have a system like git to track all changes made to the project, and allow changes to coexist on branches until ready to be merged.

I was taught how to use git about a year ago and have since been using it on most of my schoolwork and projects. Since I haven't had that much experience working on group projects, I have not had much problems with or without configuration management. However, I definitely see its value when working in a group regardless of size.

Is github popular because of git, or is git popular because of github? I think it's a little of both, since the popularity of github leads to more people using git, while people who use git find it natural to push their content to github.
