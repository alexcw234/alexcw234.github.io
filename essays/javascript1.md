## Reflecting on Javascript Part 1

### First Impression...
I have a little prior experience with Javascript, having started learning Javascript properly less than a year ago. Honestly, I was reluctant to do so at the time. I did glance at a few Javascript tutorials and examples prior to that point and was not given the best impression of the language. Keep in mind that I was a beginner computer science student back then: I was good at Java, had exposure to Python and Perl, but didn't know much else. 

Most of the code examples I stumbled on were filled with copious amounts of braces and parentheses within braces within parenthesis, some with semicolons and others without semicolons, functions within functions that called functions from who-knows-where, and all without any indentation system that could help me sort through any of it. Worst of all was "document.getElementByID" which seemed to be all over the place in the tutorials. I didn't want to have to type that out every time, and how could I even remember a name that long?

Well, it turns out that most of those tutorials were actually trying to teach me jquery, and most of the examples were just bad examples. But, again, I was totally new to computer programming: I figured that people who could code in Javascript were just naturally able to read randomly-tabbed-braces-within-parenthesis-filled code somehow and I was simply not such a person.

### Ok let's try again!

After that first impression, I gave up. But like I said, I started learning it later when I attended the AT&T Hackathon. My team and I were designing an app for the UH van service and we were using the Ionic framework, which used AngularJS. Because of that, I began to try and learn the language so I could use Angular on the project. As it turns out, a framework adds a whole new layer of complications! Still, it was an extremely valuable experience and I ended up learning and using Angular properly on a side project later on. As for Javascript itself, it wasn't until I started my job at UH Manoa College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources that I used it  separately. Until that point I only used it as required by whatever conroller or provider I had to be writing.

### Impressions Now

Although it is still a new language to me, now that I have been using it more I definitely enjoy it. I certainly like it more than Java and C++, though not as much as Python simply because of how much it is wedded to the web browser. In ICS 314 we did a basic Javascript course using freeCodeCamp. I think this was an excellent overview and I wish I had known about it when I started learning Javascript. I already learned a couple things that I hadn't known about, or had known about but never had reason to use, such as objects and I see a lot of new things that will be covered soon: I didn't know that Javascript could be object-oriented for instance. "Let" and "Const" are new to me as well.

I think the WODs that we have been doing in Javascript for this class have been helpful in learning how to approach problems efficiently and under pressure, which will be important later on during interviews.
