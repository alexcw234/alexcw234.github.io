## Reflecting on Javascript Part 1

### First Impression...
I started learning Javascript properly about 3 quarters of a year ago and honestly, I was reluctant to do so. I did glance at a few Javascript tutorials and examples prior to that point and was not given the best impression of the language. Keep in mind that I was a beginner computer science student back then: I was good at Java, had exposure to Python and Perl, but barely even knew how to read documentation. 

Most of the code examples I stumbled on were filled with copious amounts of braces and parentheses within braces within parenthesis, some with semicolons and others without semicolons, functions within functions that called functions from who-knows-where, and all without any indentation system that could help me sort through any of it. Worst of all was "document.getElementByID" which seemed to be all over the place in the tutorials. I didn't want to have to type that out every time, and how could I even remember a name that long?

Well, it turns out that most of those tutorials were actually trying to teach me jquery, and most of the examples were just bad examples. But, again, I was totally new to computer programming: I figured that people who could code in Javascript were just naturally able to read randomly-tabbed-braces-within-parenthesis-filled code somehow and I was just not such a person.
